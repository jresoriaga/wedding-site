# Gallery Images

Place your wedding/engagement photos in this folder.

## Recommended Image Setup

Name your images as:
- `1.jpg`
- `2.jpg`
- `3.jpg`
- etc.

## Image Recommendations

- **Format**: JPG or WebP for best performance
- **Resolution**: 1200px - 2000px on the longest side
- **Aspect Ratios**: Mix of landscape, portrait, and square work best
- **File Size**: Optimize images to under 500KB each for faster loading

## Tips

1. Use a mix of candid and posed shots
2. Include variety: close-ups, wide shots, detail shots
3. Keep a consistent editing style/color tone
4. 8-12 photos is usually perfect

## Need to Update the Gallery?

- Number of images
